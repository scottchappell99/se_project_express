# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the backend of the WTWR Project. It is an Express app, using MongoDB. The database is split into users and clothing items using schema and models. Every interaction is routed through the index, which then routes requests to the correct controller.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
